# The Game 

## Overview
* This is a one person game.
* The game is played with a standard 52-card deck.

## Objective
The <b>Player</b> sees a card and then guesses whether the next card from the <b>Draw Pile</b> will be higher or lower.

## Setup
1. The deck is shuffled randomly.
1. 9 cards are dealt face up (typically, in a 3x3 grid but the shape is not important) to form the <b>Gauntlet</b>.
    * Each of these 9 cards starts their own stack of cards.
1. The remaining cards (43) form the <b>Draw Pile</b>.

## Play
1. The <b>Player</b> selects a stack in the <b>Gauntlet</b>.
    * The top card in this stack will be the card against which the <b>Draw Pile</b> card will be compared.
1. Using the top card of that stack as the basis, the <b>Player</b> guesses whether the next card from the <b>Draw Pile</b> will be either higher or lower.
    * Only the value of the card (e.g., the 10 in 10 of Hearts) matters. Suits do not affect the comparisons (e.g., Ace of Clubs > King of Spades > Queen of Diamonds).
    * Aces are high (i.e., A > K > Q > ... > 3 > 2).
    * For example, if the top card in the stack is the 8 of Clubs and the next card from the <b>Draw Pile</b> is the Ace of Diamonds, the <b>Draw Pile</b> card is higher. If the <b>Player</b> guessed "higher", they'd be correct. Otherwise, they'd be incorrect.
1. If the guess is incorrect:
    1. The card from the <b>Draw Pile</b> is placed on top of the stack.
    1. That stack is declared dead (i.e., the <b>Player</b> loses a life) and that stack is inactive for the remainder of the game.
    1. Play continues by selecting a new stack if possible.
1. If the guess is correct:
    1. The card from the <b>Draw Pile</b> is placed on top of the stack.
    1. play continues by selecting a new stack if possible. 
1. Play continues until either a) there are no more cards left in the <b>Draw Pile</b> (i.e., the <b>Player</b> wins) or b) there are no active stacks left in the <b>Gauntlet</b> (i.e., the <b>Player</b> loses).
